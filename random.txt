spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"


Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

1. concert-this '<artist/band name here>'

This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API ("https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp") for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

Name of the venue

Venue location

Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

---------------------------------------------

2. spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

Artist(s)

The song's name

A preview link of the song from Spotify

The album that the song is from

---------------------------------------------

3. movie-this '<movie name here>'
This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

  * Title of the movie.
  * Year the movie came out.
  * IMDB Rating of the movie.
  * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
  * Country where the movie was produced.
  * Language of the movie.
  * Plot of the movie.
  * Actors in the movie.

  If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/

It's on Netflix!

You'll use the axios package to retrieve data from the OMDB API. Like all of the in-class activities, the OMDB API requires an API key. You may use trilogy.

---------------------------------------------

4. do-what-it-says 
Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.

Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.

***When making this command, DELETE all this shit.***

BONUS
In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called log.txt.

Make sure you append each command you run to the log.txt file.

Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
